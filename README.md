Job Portal System
📌 Project Overview

The Job Portal System is a Spring ORM-based Java application that simulates a real-world recruitment platform.
It enables companies to post jobs and manage applicants, while candidates can register, browse job listings, and apply for jobs.

The project leverages Spring ORM with Hibernate/JPA for object-relational mapping and uses a relational database ( MySQL) for persistent storage.
This application is designed to demonstrate how Spring Framework + ORM concepts can be used to build scalable, maintainable, and modular applications.
